# Telco Customer Churn Prediction MLOps System

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a deployable, real-time churn prediction service that not only predicts which customers will leave but also automatically alerts stakeholders when the incoming data distribution shifts (data drift).

## Team Members
1. Furkan Kırteke
2. Burak Koçoğlu
3. Defne Yıldırım

## Project Phases
1. **Data Pipeline & Experimentation**: EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Selection (XGBoost/Random Forest), MLflow tracking.
2. **Deployment & Inference**: FastAPI serving, Docker containerization.
3. **Monitoring & Drift Detection**: Evidently AI for drift detection and health reports.
4. **Integration & Demo**: Streamlit UI for stakeholders.
